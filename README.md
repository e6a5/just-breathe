# Just Breathe

Find your center through the simple rhythm of your own breath.

This is a gentle companion designed to guide you through a natural breathing sequence with a simple, flowing animation. There are no instructions to read and no complex settings to configure. Just open the page and breathe.

## Core Principles

- **Purity of Purpose**: To offer a space for guided breathing, and nothing more.
- **Inherent Simplicity**: No setup, no learning curve, just immediate use.
- **Universal Access**: Works on any device with a modern web browser.
- **Designed for Serenity**: A tool that remains reliable and calm, even when things go wrong.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Follow the gentle rhythm of the animation.
3. That is all.

## The Unix Philosophy in Practice

- **"Do one thing, and do it well"**: This application is dedicated entirely to the practice of guided breathing.
- **Simplicity**: It avoids build tools and compilation steps.
- **Graceful Failure**: The application is designed to degrade gracefully, with multiple fallback levels.
- **Respect for the User's Environment**: It is built with standard web technologies to ensure broad compatibility.

## For Developers

The application degrades gracefully in the following order:

- If the canvas fails, it will fall back to a text-based breathing guide.
- If JavaScript fails, it will display a static breathing guide.
- If all else fails, it will provide simple, text-based instructions.
